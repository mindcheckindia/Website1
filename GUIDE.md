### 1. Free Website Builder: Your Digital Foundation

You need a tool to build and host your single-page website. The key is to find one that's user-friendly and has a generous free plan.

*   **Top Recommendation: [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)**
    *   **Why it's great:** Carrd is specifically designed for creating simple, beautiful, one-page websites. Its drag-and-drop interface is incredibly intuitive.
    *   **Free Plan:** Allows you to build up to three sites, use all core features, and publish to a `.carrd.co` URL. It's perfect for a waitlist page.
    *   **How to use:** Pick a template that feels calm and spacious, then customize it with your text, colors, and images. You can easily embed forms from other services.

*   **Alternative: [Framer](https://www.framer.com/)**
    *   **Why it's great:** Framer is more powerful than Carrd, offering advanced design capabilities and animations. It's great if you want a slightly more polished, interactive feel.
    *   **Free Plan:** Includes Framer branding but lets you build and publish a beautiful site.
    *   **How to use:** Start with a free template and adapt it. Framer has a slightly steeper learning curve but offers more design freedom.

### 2. Free Form & Waitlist Management: Collect Your Sign-ups

Once visitors are convinced, you need a simple way to collect their email addresses.

*   **Top Recommendation: [Tally.so](https://tally.so/)**
    *   **Why it's great:** Tally offers unlimited forms and submissions for free, with no branding on the form itself. Its interface is as simple as writing a doc.
    *   **Free Plan:** Incredibly generous. It's everything you need for a waitlist.
    *   **How to use:** Create a new form with a single "Email" field and a submit button. Tally gives you a simple embed code that you can copy and paste directly into your Carrd or Framer site.

*   **Alternative: [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)**
    *   **Why it's great:** Mailchimp is an all-in-one email marketing platform. If you plan to send newsletters to your waitlist, it's a good place to start.
    *   **Free Plan:** Lets you manage up to 500 contacts and build a landing page with a sign-up form.
    *   **How to use:** Use Mailchimp's own landing page builder or create a sign-up form to embed on your Carrd/Framer site.

### 3. Free Analytics: Understand Your Visitors

You need to know how many people are visiting your site and what they're doing.

*   **Top Recommendation: [Google Analytics 4](https://analytics.google.com/)**
    *   **Why it's great:** It's the industry standard and completely free. It provides powerful insights into your traffic sources, user behavior, and conversion rates.
    *   **Free Plan:** It's a free service.
    *   **How to use:** Create a new GA4 property, and it will give you a tracking ID or code snippet. Most website builders (including Carrd and Framer) have a dedicated field where you can just paste this ID to connect your site.

### 4. Free Visual Assets: Create a Calming Aesthetic

High-quality visuals are essential for building trust and creating the right atmosphere.

    *   **What it is:** A library of beautiful, high-resolution, royalty-free photos.
    *   **Search terms to use:** "calm," "nature," "wellness," "soft light," "minimal," "serene." Look for photos with muted colors and plenty of empty space.
